## 🎮 About Me

**Game Developer | Game Designer | Project Lead**

Hi! I’m **Don Keiser**, a 22-year-old game developer with 3 years of experience working in **Unity (C#)**. I’m currently in my third year of a **Bachelor in Game Development** at *La Horde*, a French higher education school specialized in video game creation.

I’ve worked on both solo and collaborative projects, often taking on the role of **developer**, **game designer**, and **project lead**.  
I'm also passionate about **interactive narrative design** and **alternate history worldbuilding**.

## 🕹️ About My Game Projects

Most of the games showcased on this GitHub were developed in **2 to 6 weeks** — either **solo** or in **small teams** — as part of academic or personal challenges.  
While these prototypes are often unpolished or incomplete, they showcase:

- My ability to develop under tight deadlines  
- Experience working within multidisciplinary teams (artists and developers)
- Leadership and planning skills as project lead  

> 🔧 These projects were key to my growth as a developer and collaborator.

## 🌍 Alternate History & Modding Projects

Beyond game development, I’m also the creator of **“Kui Öösel Saabub”** (“When Night Falls”), an **alternate history universe** focused on cultural, linguistic, and Points of Divergence in our history.

This passion project has led to the development of several mods for grand strategy games:

- 🛠️ **Victoria 2** – focused on the 19th century part of the **KOS**
- 🛠️ **Imperator: Rome** – Cultural, regional, and religious overhauls  
- 🛠️ Additional narrative-driven content in development
- 🛠️ **A future mod of Europa Universalis 5** - focused on the 14th century part of **KOS**

This work blends **narrative depth**, **system design**, and **historical logic** — and is a major part of how I explore worldbuilding through interactive media.
